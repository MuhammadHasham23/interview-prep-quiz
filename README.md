# Linux Interview Quiz App

## Overview

The Linux Interview Quiz App is an interactive tool designed to help users prepare for Linux job interviews. The app presents a series of questions, each of which may have one or more correct answers. Users are given a limited amount of time to respond to each question. At the end of the quiz, the app provides a summary of the user's performance, highlighting the correct answers for any questions that were answered incorrectly.

## Environment Variables
We use a public quiz API to fetch question and answers. `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY` needs to be provided.

## Features

- **Timed Questions**: Each question must be answered within 45 seconds.
- **Multiple Correct Answers**: Questions may have one or more correct answers.
- **Performance Summary**: After completing the quiz, users receive a summary of their results.
- **Answer Review**: Correct answers are highlighted for any questions that were answered incorrectly.
